# Web Technologies Project

This repository contains a project developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, focusing on building a dynamic and interactive website. The project includes various web pages such as the home page, contact page, and others, with responsive and styled elements.

## Features

- **HTML Pages**: The project includes multiple HTML files that represent different sections of the website, such as:
  - Home page (`ana-sayfa.html`)
  - Contact page (`iletisim.html`)
  - Login page (`login.html`)
  - Other additional pages like `ozgecmis.html`, `sehirim.html`, etc.
  
- **CSS Styling**: Custom styles are applied through the `ilgi-alani.css` file to make the website visually appealing and responsive.

- **JavaScript Interactivity**: The `ilgj.js` file contains scripts to enhance the interactivity of the website.

- **PHP Scripts**: The project uses PHP for server-side functionality, including the contact form (`iletisim.php`) and login page functionality (`login.php`).

## Requirements

- A web server with PHP support (e.g., Apache)
- A browser to view the HTML pages
- CSS and JavaScript support for styling and interactivity

## Installation

1. **Clone or download** the repository.
2. **Set up a local server** (like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP) to run PHP files.
3. **Place the files** in the server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` in XAMPP).
4. Open the project by navigating to the HTML files (e.g., `index.html`, `ana-sayfa.html`) in a browser.

## Usage

- **Navigate between pages**: Use the navigation links on the website to explore different sections, including the home page, about page, contact page, etc.
- **Interact with forms**: The contact and login forms will send and retrieve data (ensure PHP is running for backend functionality).
- **Customize content**: Edit the HTML files to add more content or modify the structure as per your requirements.
